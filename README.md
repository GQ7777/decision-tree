# Programming Assignment 1

## Decision Tree Implementation

Dependencies:

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. sklearn

Execution:

1. Run the decision_tree.py file. No arguments required.

Output:

All the matplotlib figures will pop up on execution.

The ID3 implemented decision trees are visualized on the console.

## Directory Structure Assumption

The code has been written in a fashion which assumes all data files are in the same directory as the code.

Put the files: monks-1.train, monks-1.test, monks-2.train, monks-2.test, monks-3.train, monks-3.test, car.data; all in the same directory with the decision_tree.py file for execution.
